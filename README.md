# Traffic Light Protocol - Meeting Classification

The [Traffic Light Protocol](http://www.us-cert.gov/tlp/) (TLP) is a well-known set of classifications for sensitive information.

The TLP classification is regularly used by the CSIRT community and other organizations around the world.

I was looking for a way to indicate the TLP classification during physical meetings.

So, I created a small A4 landscape set of posters for each TLP classification to display on the door where the meeting is taking place.
