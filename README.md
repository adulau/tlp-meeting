Traffic Light Protocol - meeting classification
===============================================

The [Traffic Light Protocol](http://www.us-cert.gov/tlp/) (TLP) is a well-known set of classification for sensitive information.
The TLP classification is regularly used by the CSIRT community around the world.

I was looking for a way to state the TLP classification when doing physical meetings.

So I did small A4/US letter landscape poster for each TLP classification 
to publish on the door where the meeting is taking place.
